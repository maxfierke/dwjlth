#Do We Just Leave These Here?
###Dude, what the hell is this?
DWJLTH is a single-purpose web "application" that gives you information on whether or not you're supposed to leave your dishes at the table after you've finished eating at certain restaurants.

###How'd you get the idea?
I was eating at SmashBurger with my girlfriend and I couldn't remember if you're supposed to leave your basket at the table or take it somewhere. The answer is 'Yes, you just leave them there'.

###Alright, cool. Can I fix an answer or give you an answer for a new restaurant?
Hell yeah. Just open up an issue in the issue tracker, or if you're comfortable with git, add it yourself and submit a pull request.

###Schweet. I'm a programmer, can I add some fancy shit to this?
Sure, just [Don't Be A Dick](http://www.dbad-license.org/). That's actually the name of the license this is under.
